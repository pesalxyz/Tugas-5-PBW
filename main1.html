    <p>The word strawberry is coined from "strewn" berries about the plants and thus the "strewn berry" finally turned into "strawberry" (Roger). They are not actual fruits or berries but distended ends of the stamen of the plant. The seeds are on the external surface, rather than the internal berry. There are around 200 seeds for each berry. They are low in calories and are non-fat, loaded with vitamin C, folic acid, fiber, vitamin B6 and potassium (Roger).<br><br> Over the years they have been utilized as medications for ailments like, stained teeth, sunburns, gouts and digestion (Hopley, 9). Strawberries were served up at medieval state occasions as a show of peace, wealth, and excellence. The most well-known communal intake of strawberries is at Wimbledon annually, when strawberries and cream are eaten by very well attired Englishmen in the middle of tennis games (Hopley, 9).</p>
